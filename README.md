# Customer Churn Prediction Project README
This project was completed as part of the Digital Futures Data Analyst pathway programme, focusing on predictive modeling. The goal was to analyse customer data for Swan Teleco to understand churn drivers, predict future churn, and inform retention strategies.   

## Project Goal
Leverage customer data to understand the reasons behind customer churn, predict which customers are most likely to churn in the future, and provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve customer retention and drive sales for Swan Teleco.   

## Data
The analysis was based on a Single Customer View dataset of 7,043 current customers over the last quarter. The dataset includes 31 key metrics, covering demographic information, customer tenure, services used, and contract and payment types.   

## Methodology
The project followed a workflow including customer data collection, data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and generating insights and recommendations. A random forests model was created as the predictive model for churn likelihood.   

## Deliverables
The project produced the following deliverables:

<b>Information Presentation Deck:<\b> A presentation summarizing the analysis, key findings, and recommendations. (Attached: Information Deck.pdf)   
<b>Customer List of 500 Most Likely to Churn:<\b> A list of the top 500 customers with the highest predicted churn probability, intended for a targeted mailing campaign.   
<b>Customer List of Churn Risk:<\b> A list of all remaining customers with their individual churn risk scores, to be used by the customer service team for context during interactions.   

## Key Findings
Based on the analysis and predictive modeling, several key factors were identified as significant drivers of churn and loyalty:

## Churn Drivers:

Monthly contracts    
Short-term customers (especially within the first 5 months)    
Fiber optic internet service    
Higher monthly charges    
Reasons associated with competitor offers    
Issues with the attitude of the support team 

## Loyalty Drivers:

Two-year contracts    
Long-term customers    
Customers with dependents    
Customers who sign up for extra services like online security, online backup, and tech support    
The predictive model identified Contract Type, City, Tenure Months, Online Security, and Internet Service as the top 5 most important features in determining customer churn.   

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following strategies are recommended:

Incentive Scheme: Offer incentives to the new customer team for signing up customers to services associated with higher retention, such as two-year contracts.   
Targeted Mailing Campaign: Send mailers with offers to the top 500 customers identified as high churn risks to encourage them to stay.   
Utilize Churn Risk Scores: The customer service team should use the provided churn risk list to tailor interactions and proactively support at-risk customers.   
This project provides valuable insights and tools for Swan Teleco to improve customer retention and ultimately drive growth.
